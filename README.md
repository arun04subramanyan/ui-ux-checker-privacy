UI/UX Checker does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal user data.

The extension analyzes webpage layout, spacing, typography, and color contrast locally within the user's browser when explicitly activated by the user.

No browsing history, personal information, authentication data, financial information, or website content is collected or transmitted to external servers.

All processing occurs locally in the browser session. The extension does not use analytics, tracking technologies, or remote code execution.
